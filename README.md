### Difficulties Encountered

Several difficulties were encountered and they are as follows:

* Running of the flask technology which requires specific python environment and initially we had a
difficulty in managing that.

* Second difficulty was with respect to the Mongo Data base. Mongo was not working properly in GitBash and whenever that happened the browser did not produce any results and also no scraping was possible. Our consultancy firm requires more experience to fine tune our skills in these areas

* Our firm was able to face these Difficulties well because of the help provided by several experts associated with the Bootcamp.
